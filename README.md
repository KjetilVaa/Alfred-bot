# Alfred bot

The goal of this project was to create a robotic bot in my student dorm room. With using a raspberry pi and a TTS-engine (Text-To-Speach) and STT-engine (Speach-To-Text) that has prelearned text and speech processing, we would manage to communicate with it and make it execute tasks on voice commands. Acting like a personal butler (Hence, Alfred).

I also connected it to Facebook API and Messenger to be able to write commands to it from outside of my home in the FB messenger app.

The raspberry was hooked up to an speaker, mic and camera. Enabling different tasks. It is also easy to implement ustom functions for voice commands to read weather, bus schedule and so on...

(Deleted all (execpt one) pictures taken by the pi because of obvious reasons)

Also using a virtualenv for the python project. This is in general recommended large projects.
